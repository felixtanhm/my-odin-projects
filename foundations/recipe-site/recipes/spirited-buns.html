        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Red bean paste:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>1 cup red beans</li>
          <li>3 cups water</li>
          <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
          <li>1 tbsp vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Dough:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>4 cups flour</li>
          <li>2 cups lukewarm water</li>
          <li>1 tsp granulated sugar</li>
          <li>1 tbsp instant yeast</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Red Bean Paste:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            In the bowl of an Instant pot (or similar pressure cooker), wash the
            beans twice.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the water and cook on the program "Beans" for 60 minutes. Make
            sure the nob on your Instant Pot is pointed towards sealing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once done cooking, remove the lid and add the sugar and vanilla
            extract.
          </li>
          <li>
            Turn the Instant Pot to sauté to cook all the water out. This will
            take anywhere from 30-60 minutes depending on how much water was
            left in the pot. Make sure to stir constantly so that the beans do
            not stick to the bottom of the pot. Cook until a paste forms. This
            step requires lots of patience!5. Allow the red bean paste to cool
            before wrapping the buns.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Dough:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            In the bowl of an electric mixer (or just a large bowl), combine all
            the ingredients.
          </li>
          <li>
            Knead on medium for 10 minutes or until a firm slightly elastic
            dough forms. This dough cannot be sticky or tacky at all. It's
            better to have a firmer dough than wet. Add flour as needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cover the bowl with a damp cloth and allow to rise for 1 hour or
            until doubled in size.
          </li>
          <li>
            Dump dough out onto a floured surface and cut into equal pieces
            (whatever size you want).
          </li>
          <li>
            To wrap the buns, flat the dough into a circular disc. Try to make
            the edges slightly thinner than the center.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place 1 spoonful of red bean paste into the center. Start to pull
            the dough up while pushing the filling down with your finger. Crimp
            the edges all around.
          </li>
          <li>
            Allow to rest again under a damp towel for 10-20 minutes while your
            water comes to a boil in your steamer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Line the steamer with parchment paper and drape a damp cloth over
            it. Place buns in with about a centimeter of space around each.
            Steam for 12 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Turn off the heat and let sit for 1-2 minutes, then remove the lid.
            Otherwise you risk collapsing the steamed bun with the sudden change
            in temperature.
          </li>
        </ol>
